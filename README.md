This project describes a Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) exercise, focusing on quantization methods for converting an analog signal into digital form. It involves implementing two types of quantizers in MATLAB:

    Uniform Quantizer – Uses fixed quantization levels.

    Non-Uniform Quantizer (Lloyd-Max Algorithm) – Optimizes quantization levels iteratively.

The project requires encoding a speech signal (speech.wav) at different bit levels (N = 2, 4, 8) and evaluating performance through:

    Signal-to-Quantization-Noise Ratio (SQNR) vs. Iterations

    Comparison of Uniform vs. Non-Uniform Quantization

    Audio quality assessment using MATLAB's sound() function

    Waveform and Mean Squared Error (MSE) analysis

The goal is to analyze PCM efficiency and quantization performance in digital audio processing.
